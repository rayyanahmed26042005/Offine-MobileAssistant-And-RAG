# 🚀 Porting LLM to Mobile

Porting LLM to Mobile is a project focused on bringing Large Language Models (LLMs) to mobile devices for fully offline AI-powered assistance. The model is integrated using **React Native** and the **llama.rn** library, enabling seamless chatbot functionality without an internet connection.
